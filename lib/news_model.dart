          "As the air fills with joy and the streets come alive with high-spirited people, the importance of choosing the right outfit for the occasion becomes even more important (Source: Freepik) Holi is a festival that transcends boundaries, marking the arrival of spring with a symphony of vibrant colours and cheerful spirits. It is a day we all look forward to for many reasons, be it the food, dance, colours, or spending time with your loved ones."
          "\n\nAs the air fills with joy and the streets come alive with high-spirited people, the importance of choosing the right outfit for the occasion becomes even more important. Follow these tips and step out looking your best for the festivities!"
          "\n\nWear white or light coloured clothing"
          "White has been a common favourite on Holi for a while now. It acts as a blank canvas for the vibrant colours to pop and the best part is that it can be easily styled in a number of ways with your favourite jewellery and accessories. You can choose simple and comfortable patiala style salwar kameez or opt for kurta sets with more designs and details. Otherwise, go for the classic t-shirt and cotton pants."
          "\n\nAdd a colourful dupatta"
          "Colourful dupattas are a staple choice for Holi celebrations. Not only do they hold the power to completely transform your outfits, but also add a touch of boldness to your look. You can choose any shade and pattern you like including dupattas embroidered with intricate patterns or those adorned with playful tassels. Ideally choose something that provides a stark contrast to the rest of your outfit, to bring out the brightness of the attire."
          "\n\nWear eye-catching jewellery"
          "Make a statement with jewellery pieces that incorporate colourful elements to reflect the spirit of Holi. Choose from a range of options for earrings, necklaces, or bracelets featuring beads, tassels, pom-poms, or fabric accents in vibrant hues, or choose oxidised silver jewellery set if in doubt. These showstopping accessories will easily complement your dress as well as add a bit of playfulness to the look."
          "\n\nDon flashy shades"
          "You can never go wrong by adding a pair of brightly coloured sunglasses or tinted shades to complete the look. Look for frames in radiant hues such as bright oranges, reds, yellows, greens, and pinks. Go for a neon shade if you want to draw even more attention to your Holi ensemble. Not only that, your shades will also perform the added function of protecting your eyes from the sun's harmful rays, helping you enjoy the festival to the fullest."
          "\n\n| Tips and tricks to stay cool and hydrated this Holi"
          "\n\nChoose comfortable footwear"
          "It is essential to choose comfortable footwear for Holi. Choose closed-toe shoes or sandals that are comfortable and easy to clean, but also compliment your outfit. These types of footwear will shield your feet from all the colours and water. It is best to avoid wearing expensive or delicate footwear, as there is a possibility of them getting damaged during the festivities. Rubber sandals, flip-flops or old sneakers are the best choices for Holi celebrations.",

          "Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Saturday laid down conditions for the recognition of Bengali-speaking Bangladeshi Muslims, known as ' Miya' , as indigenous people in the state."
          "\n\nHis remarks came following the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act earlier this month."
          "\n\nHimanta Sarma asserted that for the Miya community to be recognised in Assam, people of the community must follow some cultural practices and norms. The Assamese Chief Minister highlighted limiting family size to two children, withholding polygamy, and preventing marriage of minor daughters as some of the requirements for the Miya community to be recognised as indigenous in the northeastern state."
          "\n\n'Whether 'Miyas' (Bengali-speaking Muslims) are indigenous or not is a different matter. What we are saying is that if they try to be 'indigenous', we have no problem. But for that, they have to forsake child marriage and polygamy, and encourage women education,' Himanta Sarma said on Saturday."
          "\n\nHe also underlined the significance of respecting Assamese cultural values, expressing concern over encroachments on 'satras' (Vaishnavite monasteries) land by some groups."
          "\n\n'I always tell them, there is no problem in 'Miyas' being indigenous. But they cannot have two-three wives. That is not an Assamese culture. How can one encroach 'Satra' (Vaishnavite monastery) land and want to be indigenous?' the Chief Minister asked."
          "\n\nFurthermore, the Chief Minister emphasised educational priorities, urging the Miya community to avoid madrassas and instead focus on areas such as medicine and engineering, among others. Himanta Sarma pointed out the importance of educating daughters and granting them inheritance rights over paternal properties as well."
          "\n\nThe Himanta Sarma-led BJP government in Assam cracked down against child marriage in two phases in 2023. It was found that several elderly men married multiple times, and their wives were mostly young girls, hailing from the poor section of society, Sarma had said earlier."
          "\n\nIn the first phase in February 2023, as many as 3,483 persons were arrested and 4,515 cases registered, while 915 persons were caught and 710 cases were registered in the second phase in October."
          "\n\nIn October last year, Himanta Sarma said that the BJP doesn't need the votes of Miyas for the next 10 years until they reform themselves by quitting practices such as polygamy, child marriage, among others."
          "\n\n'When elections come, I myself will request them not to vote for us. Vote for us if you follow family planning, stop child marriage and shed fundamentalism,' the Chief Minister said at the time."
          "\n\n'To complete these, it will take 10 years. We will seek votes after 10 years, not now,' he added."
          "\n\nThe Bengali-speaking Muslims, originally from Bangladesh (known as East Pakistan before 1971), have spread to several pockets of Assam. Their strength is such that they now decide the fate of nearly 30 assembly constituencies in Assam 126 seats. But in the northeastern state, both Hindus and Muslims of the Bengali-speaking immigrant community are seen as settlers."
          "\n\nThe BJP has been distancing itself from the Bangladeshi Miya Muslims, while wooing Assamese Muslims. In 2022, the state cabinet officially recognised around 40 lakh Assamese-speaking Muslims as 'indigenous Assamese Muslims', distinguishing them from the Bangladeshi immigrants. According to India Today North East, Assamese-speaking indigenous Muslims consist of 37 per cent of the total Muslim population, while the remaining 63 per cent are the Miyas.",

          "BUDAUN: The brutal murder of two minor brothers here has become the talking point in the constituency ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, with the Samajwadi Party targeting the BJP over the law and order situation while the saffron party asserting that 'rapid police action' resulted in the death of the main accused."
          "\n\nLocated in western Uttar Pradesh, Budaun is considered the gateway to the Braj region from Rohailkhand."
          "\n\nSamajwadi Party, which is eyeing to reclaim the seat that it lost in 2019, has fielded Shivpal Singh Yadav as its candidate."
          "\n\nThe BJP is yet to declare sitting MP Sanghamitra Maurya as its candidate for the Lok Sabha polls."
          "\n\nWhile the political fervour was building up in the constituency, two minor brothers were hacked to death on Tuesday evening, sending shock waves across the district and the state."
          "\n\nThe double murder has altered the political discourse in the constituency."
          "\n\nTerming the murder as a 'failure of law and order', Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said the lives of the two brothers could have been saved."
          "\n\n'The lives could have been saved had the police worked properly. They (BJP government) can't hide their shortcomings, this encounter is not going to hide their failure,' Yadav had said."
          "\n\nShivpal Yadav also attacked the government over the incident."
          "\n\n'The incident in Budaun is very saddening but the law and order of the government has failed totally. This becomes clear by incidents like these,' Yadav had said."
          "\n\nMaurya, who visited the house of the deceased boys on Wednesday, assured full support to the family members and accused the SP of doing politics over the issue."
          "\n\n'I condemn the murder of the two minor boys. Our family of the BJP is with the grieving family. I would just say to those people who are doing politics on the issue that this is not the time to do so,' she said."
          "\n\n'Samajwadi Party is doing politics on the issue because its so-called fort of Budaun was demolished by the people here in 2019."
          "\n\nThe SP candidate must have seen that no one was there to ask about him in Budaun today."
          "\n\nThis is why they are doing politics on the issue,' Maurya said."
          "\n\nShe was apparently referring to SP leader Shivpal Yadav, who first visited Budaun last week after his name was announced as the candidate for the Lok Sabha elections."
          "\n\nShivpal Yadav's son and party leader Aditya Yadav had on Thursday met the family of the deceased brothers and also met the district magistrate and SSP to lodge a complaint against Maurya."
          "\n\n'BJP MP Sanghamitra Maurya made indecent, baseless and misleading remarks against our leader Shivpal Yadav. We have given a complaint to the DM and SSP in this regard. In the coming days, a team of our lawyers will file a defamation case also,' Aditya Yadav had said."
          "\n\nWhile the leadership of the parties is busy attacking each other, the party cadre is trying to take their respective messages to the grassroot."
          "\n\n'The mere fact that anyone could commit such a crime proves that he has no fear of law in his mind,' Saumitra Yadav, a local office bearer of the SP, said."
          "\n\n'The fear and faith in law can be instilled by ensuring that the accused are held guilty in a court of justice. Encounters do little to ensure this,' he added.",
